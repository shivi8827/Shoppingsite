        <h1 class="display-3">My Shoppingsite!</h1>
        <p>my shoppingsite is an Indian e-commerce company headquartered in Bangalore, Karnataka, India and registered in Singapore.[8] The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

            The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and domestic rival, Snapdeal.[9][10] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[11] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[12] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface.
            
            In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired an 81% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing the company at $20 billion.[13] .</p>
